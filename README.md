## Movie Trailer Website
This is a simple website displaying a list of movie posters and trailers. This app was
created as a short exercise in Python classes and class instances.

Movie listings and information are stored in entertainment_center.py in instances of the
'Movie' class. The Movie class itself is in media.py. fresh_tomatoes.py contains the code
to dynamically generate an html page (fresh_tomatoes.html) based on the movies in 
entertainment_center.py.

### Instructions
This app requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

Clone the repository to your computer. To run the application, enter $ python 
entertainment_center.py in a command window. Alternatively, you can open fresh_tomatoes.html 
with your preferred browser. Click on the movie title or its poster art to view the trailer
in a YouTube video modal.

### Make Your Own Movie Page!
To create a page containing movies of your choice, change the name, link to poster image, and
link to trailer of the movies in entertainment_center.py. Make sure to add the new movie variable 
names to the 'movies' array at the bottom of the script. Run entertainment_center.py (as 
described above) to generate the new html page and it will automatically open in a browser!
