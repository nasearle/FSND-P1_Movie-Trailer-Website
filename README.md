## Movie Trailer Website
This is a simple website displaying a list of movie posters and trailers. This app was
created as a short exercise in Python classes and class instances.

Movie listings and information are stored in entertainment_center.py in instances of the
'Movie' class. The Movie class itself is in media.py. fresh_tomatoes.py contains the code
to dynamically generate an html page (fresh_tomatoes.html) based on the movies in 
entertainment_center.py.

### Instructions
This app requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

Clone the repository to your computer. To run the application, enter $ python 
entertainment_center.py in a command window. Alternatively, you can open fresh_tomatoes.html 
with your preferred browser. Click on the movie title or its poster art to view the trailer
in a YouTube video modal.

### Make Your Own Movie Page!
To create a page containing movies of your choice, edit the movie instances contained in 
entertainment_center.py. You can change the name, link to poster image, and
link to trailer of the movies already there or add entirely new movie instances. Make sure 
to add any new movie variables to the 'movies' array at the bottom of the script. Run
entertainment_center.py (as described above) to update and open your new movie trailer 
website!
